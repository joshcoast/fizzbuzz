FizzBuzz Test Part 1

# Description
This app prints out the following for a contiguous range of numbers:
1. the number
2. 'fizz' for numbers that are multiples of 3
3. 'buzz' for numbers that are multiples of 5 
4. 'fizzbuzz' for numbers that are multiples of 15

e.g. If I run the program over a range from 1-20 I should get the following output:
`1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz`
